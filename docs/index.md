# Welcome to gamagama-cli

gamagama-cli is a **Game Master Game Manager** CLI for tabletop RPGs.

It provides a structured, interactive command-line interface (CLI) to manage your campaign data. Think of it as a file system for your RPG campaign, where folders are categories (Players, NPCs, Locations) and files are data points, but with specialized commands to interact with them.

## Key Features

*   **Hierarchical Data**: Organize your campaign in a tree structure.
*   **Interactive Shell**: Navigate your data like a file system (`cd`, `ls`).
*   **Context-Aware Commands**: Commands change based on where you are in the tree.
*   **Dice Rolling**: Built-in dice roller (`roll 3d6`).
