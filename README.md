# gamagama

`gamagama` (Game Master Game Manager) is a tool to be used by a Game Master to help run a tabletop RPG. It focuses on the Role Master Unified (RMU) game system.

The core of this repo will be a command-line tool called `gamagama`, or `gg` for short. This tool can be invoked in a interactive "chat" session, to be run "live" while the Game Master (GM) is running a live action role-playing game.
